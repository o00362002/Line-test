Then include\n`lib/spreadsheets.browser.min.js` in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<script src='http://url.to/spreadsheets.browser.min.js'></script>\n```\n\nUsage is same as above, module is available at `window.Spreadsheets`:\n\n```js\nwindow.Spreadsheets(options, callback);\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nBy default, `google-spreadsheets` will attempt requests for a spreadsheet as an unauthenticated (anonymous) user. There are some caveats to this, which you should read about in the [Anonymous Requests](#anonymous-requests) section below.\n\nAs shown in the example above, you can depend on Google's official [`googleapis`](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client) module and provide it to `google-spreadsheets`. This will allow you to easily make OAuth2 or JWT authenticated requests. See the `googleapis` project for more detailed information about configuring authentication.\n\n## API\n\n### GoogleSpreadsheets(opts, callback)\n\nLoads a `Spreadsheet` from the API. `opts` may contain the following:\n\n * `key`: *(required)* spreadsheet key\n * `auth`: *(optional)* authentication key from Google ClientLogin\n\n\n### GoogleSpreadsheets.rows(opts, callback)\n\nLoads a set of rows for a specific Spreadsheet from the API. Note that this call is direct, you must supply all auth, spreadsheet and worksheet information.\n\n`opts`:\n * `key`: *(required)* spreadsheet key\n * `worksheet`: *(required)* worksheet id. Can be a numeric index (starting from 1), or the proper string identifier for a worksheet.\n * `start`: *(optional)* starting index for returned results\n * `num`: *(optional)* number of results to return \n * `auth`: *(optional)* authentication key from Google ClientLogin\n * `sq`: *(optional)* structured query (not URL encoded) - https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#sending_a_structured_query_for_rows \n\n\n### GoogleSpreadsheets.cells(opts, callback)\n\nLoads a group of cells for a specific Spreadsheet from the API. Note that this call is direct, you must supply all auth, spreadsheet and worksheet information.\n\n`opts`:\n * `key`: *(required)* spreadsheet key\n * `worksheet`: *(required)* worksheet id. Can be a numeric index (starting from 1), or the proper string identifier for a worksheet.\n * `range`: *(optional)* A range (in the format of R1C1) of cells to retrieve. e.g R15C2:R37C8. Range is inclusive.\n * `auth`: *(optional)* authentication key from Google ClientLogin\n\n### `Spreadsheet` object\n\nObject returned from `GoogleSpreadsheets()` call. This object has the following properties:\n * `title`: title of Spreadsheet\n * `updated`: date Spreadsheet was last updated.\n * `author`: object containing `name` and `email` of author of Spreadsheet.\n * `worksheets`: Array of Worksheets contained in this spreadsheet.\n\n### `Worksheet` object\n\nRepresents a single worksheet contained in a Spreadsheet. Obtain this via `Spreadsheet.worksheets`.\n\nA Worksheet has the following properties:\n * `rowCount`: number of rows in worksheet.\n * `colCount`: number of columns in worksheet.\n * `Worksheet.rows(opts, cb)`: convenience method to call `Spreadsheets.rows`, just pass in `start` and `num` - will automatically pass spreadsheet key, worksheet id, and auth info (if applicable) \n * `Worksheet.cols(opts, cb)`: convenience method to call `Spreadsheets.cols`, will automatically pass spreadsheet key, worksheet id, and auth info (if applicable). opts can contain `range`, etc.\n\n## Anonymous Requests\n\nAs mentioned earlier, `google-spreadsheets` defaults to issuing anonymous requests to the API. This will only work for reading Google Spreadsheets that have had link sharing enabled for \"Anyone on the internet\", and have been published to the web.\n\nFurthermore, the Google Spreadsheets Data API reference and developers guide is a little ambiguous about how you access a \"published\" public Spreadsheet.\n\nIf you wish to work with a Google Spreadsheet without authenticating, the Spreadsheet in question must be published using the \"Publish to the web...\" feature in the File menu in the Google Spreadsheets GUI. Use the setting \"Entire Document\" to share all tabs, or the name of an individual Sheet to publish only that Sheet. You can publish multiple Sheets one at a time. If you publish only some of the Sheets in your Google Spreadsheet the spreadsheet.worksheets array will only count published Sheets. Use the \"Web page\" setting.\n\nYou may discover that a particular public spreadsheet you're trying to anonymously read may not have had this treatment, so your best bet is to issue authenticated requests for the spreadsheet (or contact the owner and ask them to fix their spreadsheet).\n\n## Further possibilities for this library\n\n * Edit functionality\n * Sorting/filtering on row listing\n * Filtering on cell listing.\n\n## Links\n\n * <http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/>\n * <https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client>\n\n## License\n\nnode-google-spreadsheets is free and unencumbered public domain software.
